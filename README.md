Simon Says game! 
The game starts by lighting up one of the colored buttons.
The player must press the same button.
The game then lights up the first button again, followed by a second button, creating a sequence.
The player must press the buttons in the same order.
With each round, the sequence grows longer by one additional button press.
The goal is to correctly remember and repeat the increasingly complex sequences of colors.
The game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or not following the sequence correctly.
